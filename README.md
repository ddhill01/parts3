# README

This is a proof of concept for a web based version of our PdM PARTS application.

Proof of concept means we're learning and nothing else.  There are no guarantees of anything working in this repository.

Here's what we've been able to achieve:

Screenshots:  The system will alt-tab, take a screenshot, store it in the public images folder.
Cascading Dropdowns that display assets.
Fancy welcome screen with animations

Lots of other stuff that will need to be cleaned up.  This thing is like a really messy workbench where you don't have any room to set stuff down.
